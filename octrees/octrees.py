        Returns tuples of the form (score, coords, value).

        Arguments:

        - pointscore
            A function which associates to coordinates (x,y,z) a
            value, the "score". Lower scores will be returned
            earlier. A score of None is considered infinite: that
            point will not be returned.

        - boxscore
            A function which assigns to a box the lowest possible
            score of any point in that box. Again, a score of None is
            considered infinite: we cannot be interested in any point
            in that box.

        The algorithm maintains a heap of points and boxes in order of
        how promising they are. In particular, if only the earliest
        results are needed, not much extra processing is done.
